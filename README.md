Usage: 

1) python translate.py -- writes the file "translated.txt" that replaces each word in SpanishText.txt with its corresponding English word from spanishDictionary.txt. We put together the dictionary by hand, putting the first translation only. 

2) python tag.py -- reads from translated.txt and uses the grammar rules from grammarRules.py to reorder the translated text. The final translated text is put into reordered.txt.
